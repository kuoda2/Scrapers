Review Content :
So as usual i received the phone within 40hrs, Thanks to flipkart. Now i will share my instant experience after using the phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Main Config : 3GB Ram / 32GB Internal , Processor made by Samsung which very amazing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. About Looks : Very very impressive like a premium phone but back side is not so attractive, it's look a like Redmi Series Phone's as well as back camera edge style is boring but you can negotiate. (5/4)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. Screen Quality : Of course not impressive coz No AMOLED Screen so the contrast of the screen is not good (5/3)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3. Camera Quality : I'm not impress with the picture quality coz its not what Samsung provide even in his low range phones, if you compare with moto series phones i will give 10/7 to samsung and moto 10/9 (Just For Galaxy OnNXT &amp; Moto G4 Plus &amp; all other variants) also the shake reduction rate on this phone is very bad, After taking the picture (naturally our hand shake little bit) the picture is blurry or shaked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4. Sensors : Well there is lots of sensor missing in this phone but don't worry you can easily manage except "Gyroscope" this sensor is not available in this phone so if you are VR Stuff Lover this phone is not for you coz you can't play VR stuff. (5/3)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5. Sound : Not for who listing the music on speakers, While ringing it's good but not excellent  (5/4)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  6. Accessories : Yes this phone is make in india but the build quality of charger is pathetic also handfree given with this phone is old and painful (like nokia phones) coz few years ago samsung giving buds(soft rubber) handfree in this budget. (5/2)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  7. Packaging : Well I'm shocked in packaging too as soon as i see the samsung box it's look they given me a 2 year old box :/ (5/1)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have not tried games coz i'm not game geek but it will gives you super speed with games too coz Samsung processor is very fast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People bought this phone coz samsung release 32GB Internal 1st time in this budget like me but guys believe me they was out lots of wonderful things from this phone Like Amoled Screen, Fast Charging, Buds Handfree and few others which make your phone beautiful and powerful. This phone is over priced (15000 Max) if you wan't this phone i will suggest you bought this with cashback offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I will update after 1 or 2 months.

  The mobile is good enough for daily uses.. But battery &amp; camera department lacks a little bit.
  <br/>
  Battery does average performance &amp;
  <br/>
  Camera could have been better keeping the price range. Afterall an Awesome mobile.

Review Content :
I am using this phone for the past 1 month. And have to admit, i am really impressed.
  <br/>
  I am not a Samsung fan. But gotta give credit for this handset.
  <br/>
  1. Looks wise its the best in class (below 20,000).
  <br/>
  2. Metal body with Gorilla glass IV makes it a premium bodied cellphone.
  <br/>
  3. The performance of Exynos 7870 is flawless. I am not a heavy gamer so maybe i didn't encounter lags or crashes. But it works flawlessly for games likes asphalt 8, gta etc.
  <br/>
  4. Have to admit, its camera is the best in class, i have not used honor 8 but i compared it with moto g4+ and it clicked better, more detailed and natural pictures of the same thing at the same time. I will surely recommend it if you want a great camera phone for mid range budget.
  <br/>
  5. The viewing angle is not as good as redmi note 4 or moto g5. But the colour reproduction is great nevertheless.
  <br/>
  5. The biggest advantage is it doesn't get as heated as any redmi note3/4 or moto g4+/5. It doest get much heated. So that's a great thing about this phone.
  <br/>
  5.  The disappointment is it's battery. It can go 24 hours if you just talk and surf net minimum.
  <br/>
  But if you are continuously youtubing or video calling or online gaming then it goes around for 10-14 hours max. This is a serious disappointment as i am always playing Clash of clans. But not an issue I have a 20000mah mi power bank, so its a win win for me.
  <br/>
  6. Battery takes around 80 minutes to fully charge so i would say that's fast as it doesn't have turbo charging facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On my opinion, i would surely give this phone a thumbs up.
  <br/>
  Your opinions may vary, but i have used this phone and above mentioned phones and i have shared what i experienced. That's why i reviewed it a month after purchasing.

I am big fan of Samsung phones. And this one is Best product from Samsung through Flipkart under 20K. Both cameras are working great even in low light with very good screen display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giving my views after Using this phone from last 20 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery backup is good for single day use but intially drains very fast from 100 to 94.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guys go for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After used samsung grand max again a very good product from samsung.
  <br/>
  Overall satisfied with phone and flipkart service is very good.

First got a dent material.
  <br/>
  But big thanks to flipcart for the new piece .
  <br/>
  About this cell phone the camera is too bad... phots got very very blur when you zoom it.
  <br/>
  Definetly its not a 13 m.p cam.
  <br/>
  Got the badest experience on front camera  the pics are not clear and if you on the selfi mode its look like a 3.d image which looks fake..
  <br/>
  Battry life is very less. Need to charge 3 times in my 9 office working hours as my net is on continuously.
  <br/>
  Bad celphone.
  <br/>
  Not recommend.
  <br/>
  I was fan of samsung cam quality but now this cell phone changed my view. Never samsung again.. 18400/-not worth it.

I have been using this phone for about 10 days &amp; honestly speaking I'm very much satisfied with this phone, or rather I must say that I'm in love with this phone
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera quality is awesome, both indoor &amp; outdoor shots have decent quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Design is super awesome, specially display has curvy edges which gives an awesome feel. Just for some screen protection, I have applied a glass protector. But the touch experience on bare screen or without protector is simply awesome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From back it's very beautiful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performance is good. Battery back up is also good. By using both SIMs and 4G &amp; Wi-Fi in my whole day, fully charged battery gives me  backup of about half to quarter a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will simply fall in love with this phone when you use it.

  Pros are it's look,Speed,fingerprint sensor etc
  <br/>
  Few cons are it's front camera is not upto mark, battery backup  is not very good.

Review Content :
Bought it at  16900 although prices reduced to  15900 after two days.
  <br/>
  Delivered in 48hrs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearance and build-quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros:
  <br/>
  1. The black-grey one is among the best looking smartphones at present.
  <br/>
  2. The metal body just looks premium.
  <br/>
  3. No protruding camera.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  1. The metal body, although with a matt finish, is slippery and a dirt magnet.
  <br/>
  2. SIM and micro SD card trays have to be pulled out with the help of a given pin. The hole on the tray is susceptible to damage/bending. Doesn't look long lasting. One should change sims/cards less frequently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros:
  <br/>
  1. Both the front and rear cameras are good in indoor and low-light conditions. For very bright-light use you have to focus on some dark object or use HDR mode to avoid over exposure. Details are also good.
  <br/>
  2. Display flash on the front is bright enough. My usage of flash with front camera is minimal so do not feel the need of flash here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  1. Shooting low-light brings in noise in photos.
  <br/>
  2. Auto-focusing is pretty slow compared to the price range of the phone, which is more evident while shooting videos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performance:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3GB RAM and Octa-core processor work like how they should. Cannot comment on heavy-gaming as I don't use phone for that, normal-gaming is good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Software and UI:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I personally like the Samsung UI and launcher more than the Google Now launcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  -secure folder is an awesome feature. You can secure anything from apps to images. It is like a phone within a phone. No more privacy concerns when you give your phone to someone else.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  -do not like the secure-wifi notification popping up every now and then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Display-
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PLS-TFT (IPS) display is good and viewing angles are alright. AMOLEDs with their disadvantage of decreasing quality and pixel burns over time were a big NO for me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery-
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3300mAh is good for all day normal usage. Battery is almost directly proportional to screen on time. The top end of the battery i.e. 100 to 70% drains very fast but after that from 70 to 5% you get long battery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sound:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speakers are good for the phone with stereo like sound. The speaker is on the right side above power button, which has both advantage (sound playing irrespective of whether the phone is placed screen up or screen down) and disadvantage (left hand index finger obstructs the speaker during tilt operations).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phone doesn't heat up irrespective of what I do. During gaming, it gets mildly warm. Something like this in a metal body phone is awesome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fingerprint sensor is great. No problems with that. Don't need to wake the phone first for unlocking.

I am writing after 1 week use. The phone has stunning looks and really smooth to operate. I was using 5.5 inch mobile previously but this 5.5 is compact compared to the previous YU YUREKA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery backup is really good. I'm using Jio 4G yet battery is good. No heating too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Very good display. Finger print sensor is also good responsive.
  <br/>

  When I hold the device in hand it feels like a class device. I'm fully satisfied with it.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Can blame the seller as the item was sealed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Requesting the seller to return and reship new device.

Review Title : Worth the money (Not really after 4 months usage)

Upvotes : 145

Downvotes : 71

Review Content :
Pros:
  <br/>
  Stylish looks (Still hold good)
  <br/>
  Powerful processor (Not really. It performs worse that Redmi 3s Prime)
  <br/>
  Good RAM (Horrible RAM management. None of the Apps stay in memory. It starts again)
  <br/>
  Sufficient ROM (Still hold good)
  <br/>
  Nice display (Still hold good but AMOLED sold hv been given at this price)
  <br/>
  Good battery backup (Depends on your usage completely. Hogs battery while taking photos)
  <br/>
  Two independent sim plus card slot (Network reception not the best. At times can't place calls while network is showing full bar)
  <br/>
  Speaker on side does not get covered (Holds good)
  <br/>
  Good camera both front and back (Low light photography is impossible. Fails to focus)
  <br/>
  No or minimum heating during long call or gaming (Holds good)
  <br/>
  Charges pretty fast without fast charging. You get about 25-30% in an 15 mins charge. (Holds good but make sure you wait for the LED to turn green for the charging to complete even though it displays charge 100%)
  <br/>
  Overall nice built quality (Still holds good)
  <br/>
  Assurance of Samsung brand (Well not yet tested)
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  Missed on ambient light and gyroscope sensor. Expected at this cost. (Totally Unacceptable)
  <br/>
  Fingerprint sensor is a bit tricky and may take couple of tries (But works good now)
  <br/>
  Processor &amp; GPU good for most games but not for high end games like Nova 3 or CoD or even Asphalt at high graphics mode (Terribly underperforms)
  <br/>
  RAM management not the best. Most games don't resume but restarts. (Even Chinese phones don't have this issue now a days)
  <br/>
  Screen does not light up upon new notification. Had to install Glimpse software to get it lighted up. Should have been an on/off option. (Surviving with it)
  <br/>
  MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint bundled in 6.0 update. Cannot be uninstalled. (Even Facebook, unbelievable)
  <br/>
  Being a new model maybe lacking proper accessories. Curved edges does not suite for a tempered glass. Looks odd. (Managed to get a back cover but tempered glass is still a issue)
  <br/>
  Addition:
  <br/>
  Back button is a botheration particularly while charging. You have press it couple of times to make it work, maybe more. It happens at time while not charging also.
  <br/>
  My 32GB card was shown corrupted on the phone which was running fine on my Lumia earlier but is working fine on my laptop.
  <br/>
  UI is plagued with occasional freezes. At least one restart in a day is a must.
  <br/>
  At times it says cannot place call over my Jio sim inspite of full tower. Have to disable and re-enable sim to make calls again.
  <br/>
  Overall:
  <br/>
  Edited: Stay away from this one at all costs. You will have much better models at same or lesser price. Don't fall for Samsung. They have reduced price by 2.5k in 4 months which means early adopter are scapegoats. Also entry-level or mid-range customers mean nothing to Samsung. They are only concerned with their premium customers of the Note and similar range. Other just pay up for the sporting the Samsung logo I suppose. (Good phone for business use with casual gaming. All day battery and no or minimum heating is a big plus. But Samsung should not have skimped on the sensors and use a Snapdragon processor or a better GPU at least. If you can live without VR then it is a good option in branded segment.)
  <br/>
  Reducing rating to 2 Star from 4 based on long term usage experience

Review Content :
I ordered this product as it seemed Good.. But it completely disappointed my experience of buying The Samsung Galaxy Onn Next.. From Day1 it had a lot of heating issues. After charging it completely, as soon as you unplug the phone from the charger battery the phone just drains by 25% to 30%. Attempted for a replacement, finally after almost 7days got a replacement from Flipkart and their so called Vendor with a lot of Hassles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The replacement which I got is also having the same issues as the earlier phone. And now I don't have the option of replacement. I have to go the Samsung Gallery to get it checked. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  **Humble Request: PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.. It's waste of money**
  <br/>
  <br/>

  This phone is worth every penny. I really don't understand why some morons compare samsung to cheap Chinese phones. Display, camera, finger print, sound quality... Everything is just awesome. Killer looks. Below 20k its d best investment. Don't waste ur hard earned money on cheap Chinese devices. U can blindly go for Samsung on nxt. Thanks for reading guys. Cheers.

Just perfect one...I am sharing my thoughts after 3 days of use...Firstly the excellent  packaging  from flipkart and delivery in three days....The phone has a very stylish  look and I got it for Rs 15400.I have read some of the reviews  on this phone about the bad battery  of the phone but I don't  know  in which  concept  they were sharing that if you are not a extreme gamer then the battery will last for a day.The charging is very fast.The camera both front and back is excellent.Out of 3gb ram you can use 1.5 gb near about and the rest  used by system.The display  is also very nice.The most important  thing is that you can use both two SIM card as well as a memory card.Out of 32gb 24.1gb can be used.The fingerprint  sensor  is working  very finely and smoothly. I would  like to suggest every Samsung  lover that if they are looking for a phone below 17000 then go for it..Not writing  anything   more today if you like my comment press the like button and if you do not like my comment press the unlike button.onething I want to suggest  everyone that always but that phone which suits you don't buy phone by listening  to others they will confuse you if the configuration  suits you go for.Samsung is one of the best mobile manufacturing  company...Thanks for reading it...

Purchased the phone at 1AM and Flipkart delivered it by 3PM. Very fast delivery.  Every thing is working fine except the back button touch. Requested for return to replace the piece. Waiting for Flipkart response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When on SIM is in 4G, the other SIM will be in 2G. In MOTO G4 Plus, the other SIM can be kept in 3G when one sim is in 4G.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pone is looking good.

  Flipkart replaced the phone. The replaced mobile is working fine.

Review Title : Flipkart, Samsung and his technician cheated with Customer

Review Content :
I have purchased Samsung On Next on 3rd April 2017. Flipkart was delivered the same on 5th April 2017. Pic I got was good, but while using the same, battery drain very quickly.  I called to customer care of Flipkart for the same but they asked to do some changes in phone, but still problem persist, so I called once again, then they said that technician will visit to check the phone.Technician visited, checked the same and said that there is no problem in the phone. While communication with technician on phone  before he visited  to check the phone, he said that there is problem in battery on Samsung On Next phone. phone was drain quickly upto 50% then start drain slowly. How technician differ his statement after checking the phone. Also he said that 4% battery will drain in 10min if you use your phone, but when I asked him why not applicable the same for my On 8 phone. He said that do not compare with other phones. I am really not satisfy on technician comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also I checked the others review regarding the same, Same review I found on the flipkart, but Flipkart &amp; his technician refused to accept the battery issue. Even while in Flipkart Exchange offer they are not keep on next phone in exchange offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flipkart is not ready to refund my money nor replace the same on technician comments. They trust on their technician but not on my comments and customers review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hence forth I decided not to purchase any goods on Flipkart, because Flipkart not understand customers feeling. There customer support team said that whether Customer is satisfy or not  doesn't bother them. they work with their policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am really do not understand who is cheated me, Flipkart, Samsung , Technician or All.

Review Content :
M going to write a detailed review of this phone for those who ought to buy it...
  <br/>
  Pros:
  <br/>
  1) superb Built quality....it has metallic unibody so its very different from vintage Plastic phones Samsung used to make... it feels very Soothing and Premium in hands.... both the black and gold variants look gorgeous
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) Camera : Both the front and the rear cameras gv excellent images in both outdoor and indoor locations... No other phone can provide such quality camera in this price range and i mean No other phone... the color saturation is amazing... Though it lacks front camera flash people interested in that feature may switch to Samsung on8...
  <br/>
  3) Fingerprint Sensor : This is the thing to look out for as people complained abt other budget phones providing Fingerprint sensors so here is Samsung... the sensor is very responsive and as u can expect surpasses its competitors quality wise.... so its d latest addition in d Samsung budget phone range
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4) Processor : The processor is great and there is no lag in the performance of the phone.. Gamers cant complain as it plays Asphalt 8 and oothe high end Vfx games smoothly without any lag... The processor is better than Samsung On8... The Exynos Processor prevents the phone from heating even on high performance and heavy gaming..
  <br/>
  5) 3 Gb RAM is a ggrea addition to this series and it makes the phone blazing fast and its a breathe of fresh air for those who were bored with the Samsung 2gb stuff in all phones... 32Gb ROM ( Internal Memory ) complements the RAM and gives a change of taste so the 2GB/ 16GB combo is now Past...
  <br/>
  6) Full HD screen : though its a TFT screen and not Super Amoled no1 can complain abt it...iis just as gud as IPS pannels offered by other mobiles in this price range and watching movies here is an amazing experience
  <br/>
  7) The power  key, Volume keys and Speaker all r located in perfect position specially the Sidewise position of the speakers is refreshing and gives the phone a fresh new look... The speaker is loud enough and far better than the J series phones..
  <br/>
  6) The Battery backup is great as well...
  <br/>
  7) The presence of LED Notification light is overwhelming as it was absent in many Samsung budget as well as high end phones..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  1) The Capacitive keys aren't Backlit.... though dts not a feature people take in2 acct nowadays....
  <br/>
  2) SuperAmoled is something dt cud have been given as phones like On8 J7 J5  r having dt as well.... but still the display is very gud and users wont complain
  <br/>
  3) The On Nxt lacks Sensors like the gyroscope  so it cant be used for Virtual reality also Ambient light sensor isnt there... so users will miss the VR stuff on this device.... it shud have been there cz evn low range phones have these sensors nowadays
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Review: Except the VR users the phone will fascinate all others as its a budget beast and the best phone u can get in this range...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  *** also the device is a MAKE IN INDIA product dts y Samsung cud afford to give more features in dis price range as the Import duties and other Taxes wernt applied...
  <br/>
  Go 4 it guys..

You have again created wonders Flipkart.

  I ordered Samsung Galaxy On NXt and you have delivered GADHI detergent SOAP for 16900/-
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's so embarassing that we are so helpless in front of this fake seller companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  * I have called customer care, i have called delivery executive, i have called the escalation department - But no body is aware of what has happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ** The Phone which was to be delivered on 7th June has now got posponed till 19th June - All thanks to Flipkart and its teraffic service
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ** The best part is they say " SIR ITNA TO WAIT KARNA PADEGA - HAMARI INVESTIGATION ME ITNA TIME TO LAGTA HI HAI - AMIT "
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ** Thanks for the support flipkart - i hope i will get my hard earned moeny back and i promise after that will never dare to buy anything from you people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ** I don't want my phone now just need by hard earned money back - that too by God Grace "

Review Content :
As of now, feel awesome. The standard and quality of samsung are not compromised and the thikness is just awesome. However the following are points worth noticing:
  <br/>
  (a) it is compactible with  2 nano SIMs
  <br/>
  (b) the back cover is not removable
  <br/>
  (c) the SIM/SD Card trays can be removed only by pushing the pin, provided as acessory. But imagine, if you need to take out the tray to replace or remove the SDCard in a awkward place, it can become a headache.
  <br/>
  (d) it has got fingerprint sensor, which I did not know untill I had received the item.
  <br/>
  (e) with power saving mode, the 3100mah battery is lasting well. My first recharge lasted more than 24 hrs, with dual SIM on, Jio SIM being used to its limit..
